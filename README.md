# calculator

This is a basic calculator.

It has the ability to perform calculations. It has the clear button that resets back to zero and it also has the ability to input a bunch of numbers.

It is hosted on github pages: [Calculator](https://erehmaryann.github.io/calculator/) 

And it is fully responsive.

Thanks!
